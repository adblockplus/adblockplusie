    <title>Installation for Adblock Plus for IE</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Installation Goals</h1>
        <h2>Use Cases Supported</h2>
            We have three basic use cases:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Individual Users</b>.
                    <p>
                        For individuals, we have the distinction between initial installation and upgrade installation.
                        For initial installation, we provide as single <code>.exe</code> file that can be downloaded and run.
                        This executable handles both 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows automatically.
                        It provides an ordinary user interface.
                        For upgrade installation, we use the update facility inside <code>libadblockplus</code> to automatically download an updater.
                        The updater is an <code>.msi</code> package, either a 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate.                        
                    </p><p>
                        For the single <code>.exe</code>, we use the Wix <code>burn</code> tool, whose output is bootstrap executable.
                        The bootstrapper contains, as internal payloads, both 32- and 64-bit <code>.msi</code> files
                            in order to deal with an important limitation of the Windows installer.
                        These are essentially the same as the individual upgrade files that are delivered automatically,
                            although the same payloads may be arranged a bit differently. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Corporate Deployment</b>.
                    <p>
                        For corporate users, we provide <code>.msi</code> files that can be centrally deployed.
                        As required, we provide two <code>.msi</code> files, one for 32-bit Windows and one for 64-bit.
                        These files are able to be run without a user interface for headless, remote-controlled installation. 
                    </p><p>
                        We provide <code>.msi</code> files with user interfaces,
                            rather than ones without.
                        This requires the adminstrator to run the installers with command line arguments,
                            but that's typical already.
                        The reason to provide a user interface is allow administrators to prepare their installations with feedback.
                        These are the same <code>.msi</code> packages as above, but with the UI conditionally compiled into the package.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Developers</b>.
                    <p>
                        For developers, we provide a mechanism by which the plugin will function
                            either in-place, with no file copying, or with minimal file copying.
                        There is a silent and rapid way of installing the plugin
                            that is suitable for integration into larger automatic build and test.  
                    </p><p>
                        This use case is not presently supported separately,
                            since it requires code changes.
                        File locations are currently scattered throughout the code,
                            and these locations do not admit anything simpler than a regular install.
                        Regardless, when this use case is ready, it will use per-user installation,
                            which avoids invoking the UAC and allows completely automatic installation with no interactive user input.                        
                    </p>                    
                </li>
            </ul>
            
    <h1>Technical Details</h1>
        <h2>Current Installations</h2>
            <p>
                Well, the current planned installation.
                The actual code doesn't quite match reality yet.
            </p>
            
            <h3>User Data Directory</h3>
                <p>
                    In Windows Vista and later, Internet Explorer runs Browser Helper Objects in low-integrity mode.
                    This mode does not exist on XP and earlier.
                    The ordinary user data folder is a medium-integrity object on Vista and later.
                    Hence the user data folder perforce differs between these versions of Windows.
                    This directory is available in installer property <code>APP_DATA_FOLDER</code>.
                </p><p>
                    The algorithm to obtain this variable depends upon the Windows version.
                    For Vista and later, we search the registry for <code>AppDataLow</code>,
                        which is a symbol not known to the Windows Installer,
                        but which does have a well-known GUID.
                    This directory is available for low-integrity processes to write to.
                    For XP and earlier, we use the Windows installer property <code>AppDataFolder</code>,
                        documented as the "full path to the Roaming folder for the current user." 
                </p><p>
                    Underneath <code>APP_DATA_FOLDER</code> we create a directory for Adblock Plus to use for itself.
                    It's available symbolically as installer property <code>ABP_APPDATA_FOLDER</code>.
                    This is the current per-user data.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>settings.ini</code>.
                        This is the user settings file.
                        We can eliminate that from the installation by writing out a default if not present,
                            either in the installer or the plugin itself.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Application Binary Directories</h3>
            
                <h4>Ordinary Per-Machine</h4>
                
                    <p>
                        Note:
                        All 64-bit objects are simply absent in 32-bit installs.
                        With one exception (the engine), all the files in the 32-bit installation are also in the 64-bit one.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

            <h3>Registry Entries</h3>
            [Incomplete]
            From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa384231%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Process Interoperability on MSDN</a>:
            "On 64-bit Windows, 64- and 32-bit in-process servers should use the InprocServer32 entry."
            
    <h1>Reference</h1>
    It would seem sensible to use a single MSI for both 32- and 64-bit versions. 
    Indeed, there's a Stack Overflow question exactly on this topic.
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3724956/single-msi-to-install-correct-32-or-64-bit-c-sharp-application">Single MSI to install correct 32 or 64 bit c# application</a>
    The answer, however, is no.
    This blog post explains why.
